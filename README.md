# StayMate (Online Hostel Management System)

StayMate is an online hostel management system that allows users to apply for admission to hostel rooms, 
view their profile settings, pay rent, check the hostel menu, register complaints, and leave feedback. In addition, 
users can submit leave letters and vacating letters through the user dashboard. Admins can then review and approve or 
reject these letters, and provide comments to users regarding the status of their requests.

##

* Users can fill out an admission form that collects their personal details. After taking admission, users can book the type of room they prefer, such as one share, two share, or four share.

* The user home module of StayMate is designed to provide users with a personalized experience after logging in to their accounts. This module includes features such as profile settings, rent payment, hostel menu, leave letter submission, complaint registration and review submission.

* The admin module provides hostel administrators with a comprehensive system to manage the hostel's operations, from user management and room management to complaint management, payment management, and food menu management. This module can help streamline hostel operations and provide a better experience for residents.
